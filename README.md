# OMSCS Resources

This is a set of resources that are available to OMSCS students at Georgia Tech. This site is not sponsored or officially affiliated with Georgia Tech.

I do not maintain any of these resources and so questions regarding them should be directed to their maintainers. Students may share resources as they wish, but please do not violate any Georgia Tech or course rules. If you become aware of an item on the list that violates the [Honor Code](http://osi.gatech.edu/content/honor-code) please notify me and I will remove it.


- [OMSCS Website](https://www.omscs.gatech.edu/):
  General information. Information includes which classes are available, information about specializations, details on tuition, calendar deadlines, and iinformation about how to apply among other details.  
- [OMSCentral](https://omscentral.com/courses):
  Course reviews provided by students. For most OMSCS classes you can see the average time spent per week, how difficult students found the material, and how much students enjoyed the courses among other things.  
- [OMSCS Wikidot](http://omscs.wikidot.com/courses:list-of-courses):
  Has more specific course informaiton than can be found on each course website. In some cases a previously used sylabus is available as well as descriptions of projects/homework assignments. There are some things that professors don't allow to be shared outside of class, so many courses have some gaps, but for manyt here are some helpful hints to help students get a head start and to know what to expect.
